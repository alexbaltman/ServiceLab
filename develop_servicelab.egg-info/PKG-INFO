Description: servicelab
        ==========
        
        servicelab is a virtual environment for testing service deployments.
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        ```
        ./stack workon [servicename]
        ./stack up
        ./stack deploy
        ```
        
        ## ./stack Command Reference
        
        ```
        ./stack workon [servicename]
        ```
        Sets up the environment for working on a particular service.  Expects a repo for the form "service-[servicename]" in gerrit.
        Services get installed into `services/`.  The target service is symlinked to `service/` for ease of use.
        
        ```
        ./stack up
        ```
        Runs vagrant up
        
        ```
        ./stack deploy
        ```
        Runs heighliner deploy on the target service
        
        ```
        ./stack clean
        ```
        Destroys existing vagrant vms and unlinks the target service.  Start work again with `./stack workon`. Services cloned to `services/` remain intact.
