Welcome to ServiceLab
=====================


Servicelab simplifies and streamlines the developer's workflow.

**Use Cases**

- There needs to be an environment where we can bootstrap a service seamlessly.
- Manging the processes and artifacts requires too many resources from SDLC.
- We need to work better together to streamline our operations.
- We need to automate repetitive tasks like provisioning, testing, and deployment.
- There is too much complexity for new developers. We need one clear platform to begin work.

**Features**

- Streamlines the development workflow into the Stack CLI.
- Automates the deployment of a new environment.
- Creates a repo in Gerrit and allows you to review it.
- Describes the infrastructure of CCS-data sites and environments.
- Spins up Vagrant dev environments.
- ...much more
