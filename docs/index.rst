Welcome to ServiceLab
=====================
Stack is a ServiceLab command line interface that is designed to automate everyday development tasks. It is created by
the Cisco Cloud Services' SDLC team to help facilitate various systems processes. We recommend that you get started
with :ref:Installation' and then head over to :ref:'Quickstart'. Besides the *Quickstart*, there is also a more detailed
:ref:'Tutorial' that shows how to execute common commands.

Use Cases
---------
- Developing through the pipeline is time consuming.
- Environments are sparse.
- Environment stability is low and it's hard to figure out where to develop code.
- There are no environments available to bootstrap your service framework.
- Manging the processes and artifacts created from the pipeline is difficult and requires lots of time from SDLC.


Features
--------
- Streamlines the development workflow into the command line
- Automates the deploy of a new environment
- Creates a repo in Gerrit with the ability to review others
- Describes sites and environments
- Spin up Vagrant development environments and test
- ...much More!
