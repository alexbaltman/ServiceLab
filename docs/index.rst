Welcome to ServiceLab
=====================
Stack is a ServiceLab command line interface that is designed to automate everyday development tasks. It is created by
the Cisco Cloud Services' SDLC team to help facilitate various systems processes such as creating repos, listing sites,
and creating environments.

We recommend that you get started with :ref:Installation' and then head over to :ref:'Quickstart'. Besides the
*Quickstart*, there is also a more detailed :ref:'Tutorial' that shows how to execute common commands.

**Use Cases**

- Development environments are sparase.
- Developing through the pipeline can be time consuming.
- Environment stability is low and it's difficult to determine where to code.
- There needs to be an environment where we can bootstrap a service framework.
- Manging the processes and artifacts requires too many resources from SDLC.

**Features**

- Streamlines the development workflow into the command line
- Automates the deploy of a new environment
- Creates a repo in Gerrit with the ability to review others
- Describes sites and environments
- Spin up Vagrant development environments and test
- ...much More!
