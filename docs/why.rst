The other question is why Stack works the way it does. To be filled in.

In this particular case, Stack attempts to stay with a handful of accepted
paradigms for building command line interfaces that can be well documented
and tested.


Why No Auto Correction?
-----------------------

The reason for this is that it's a liability for backwards compatibility.
If people start relying on automatically modified parameters and someone
adds a new parameter in the future, the script might stop working.  These
kinds of problems are hard to find so Stack does not attempt to be magical
about this.
