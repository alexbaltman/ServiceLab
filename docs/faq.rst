This page answers some of the often asked questions about Stack.


Why is it called Stack?
-----------------------
The name Stack was chosen because in computer science, a stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type
that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection,
and pop, which removes the last element that was added.


Why is my create repo not working?
----------------------------------
Are your ssh keys configured to work with Gerrit?

Did you give the repo a name?

Check if the repo already exists.

Why is there no Python 2.3/2.4/2.5/3.1/3.2 support?
---------------------------------------------------
Because Python 2.7 is what we use.
