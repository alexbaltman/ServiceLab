Introduction
=============

**The goal of the SDLC Process is to create an SDLC tool chain to enable:**

-   Standardized, consistent, repeatable way of working

-   Multiple pipelines feeding development and production environments

-   Software development discipline at infrastructure and application levels

-   Automated unit and functional testing

-   Traceability of artifacts to production deployment

-   Security measures for protecting sensitive environment data

-   Self-service on-boarding process for any service added to cloud environments (e.g. Identity, Load balancers, Marketplace)

-   Driving all change activity through SDLC (develop, build; deploy; auto-healing; auto-scaling)


**Guiding Design Principles**

-   Actionable:  SDLC tool chain must support deployments â€“ fresh and upgrades and roll backs of single, multiple and all components using same operator interface

-   Per-defect / commit granularity of deployment on a per-component basis is requested as a stretch goal

-   Value-focused and value stream engineered: Support for components in SDLC tool chain must be prioritized based on value to cloud creation and defect minimization, and operationalization ROI metrics.

-   Integrated & Holistic:  SDLC design considerations must be based upon 100% integrated & automated cloud management activities with holistic framework for end to end operations and management

-   Evolving / Living: SDLC tool chain and environment must support a dynamic environment capable of scaling to integrate new components internally and externally sourced and must be operable by internal and external stakeholders
